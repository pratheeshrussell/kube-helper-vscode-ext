    *   StatefulSets
    *   DaemonSets
    *   ReplicaSets
    *   Ingresses

    *   **Secrets**
    *   **Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)**
    *   **Custom Resources (CRs)** for installed CRDs
    *   Namespaces, Nodes, Persistent Volumes, Storage Classes, ClusterRoles, ClusterRoleBindings, Roles, RoleBindings, ServiceAccounts, and IngressClasses.
*   **View Resource Details**:
    *   Inspect the full **YAML definition** of any supported resource.
    *   View detailed `kubectl describe` like output.
    *   Access **related Kubernetes events** for easier debugging.
*   **Edit Resources**: Modify live resource configurations using an integrated YAML editor.
*   **Pod Logs**:
    *   Stream logs directly from pods into VSCode.
    *   **Support for selecting specific containers** within a pod.
    *   **View previous logs** for terminated containers.
*   **Exec into Containers**: Open an interactive terminal session within your pod's containers.
*   **Port Forward Resources**: Easily forward local ports to pods and services.
*   **Contextual Actions**:
    *   Quick action menus (view details, logs, exec, edit, delete) available directly in resource lists for faster workflows.
*   **Resource Tree View**:
    *   Visualize your Kubernetes resources in a hierarchical tree/graph structure, offering an intuitive understanding of relationships (e.g., Deployment ‚Üí ReplicaSet ‚Üí Pods).
    *   View resource status and basic details directly within the tree.
    *   Currently accessible via the 'Resource Tree' tab in the cluster-wide view for a selected namespace.

## üõ† Requirements

*   **`kubectl` CLI**: This extension relies on the `kubectl` command-line tool. Ensure it's installed and configured to connect to your Kubernetes cluster(s), and that it's accessible in your system's PATH.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Extension Settings

*   Activate the extension by clicking on its icon in the VSCode sidebar.
*   The extension uses your active `kubectl` context by default. You can switch contexts using `kubectl config use-context <context-name>` or via other Kubernetes context management tools.

## üêû Known Issues

*   While significantly expanded, the extension may not yet support every niche aspect of all Kubernetes resource types.
*   The Resource Tree View is in its initial version; performance and advanced relationship linking (e.g., ConfigMaps/Secrets to workloads) will be improved in future updates.
*   Feel free to open a [feature request](https://github.com/pratheeshrussell/kube-helper-vscode-ext/issues/new?template=2-feature-req.yml) or [bug report](https://github.com/pratheeshrussell/kube-helper-vscode-ext/issues/new?template=1-bug-report.yml).
